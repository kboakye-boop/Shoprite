Shoprite Inventory System 

##Description
The main purpose of the app is to enable users to manage their inventory efficiently.
The app provides functionalities for two types os users, an Admin user and an Attendant user.
An admin user can manage attendant users, products and product categories.
An Attendant user can manage sales, view sales and print receipts.
we faced few problems with the developmemnt of the app such as havin more than one Admin user.
During evolution of the app we intend to include a functionality that will enable an Admin to create other Admin users.
